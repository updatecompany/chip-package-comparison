# Chip Package Comparison

A comparison of chip packages and SMD land patterns from major manufacturers (NXP, STM, etc.)

Every manufacturer has a slightly different interpretation of chip packages, even if they call them by the same JEDEC or shorthand name.

This page gathers up the diagrams and package names used by each company and compares them by looking at specific excerpts from chip datasheets.

Be careful, though. Always doublecheck the footprint for your specific chips, these guys don't make it easy!

If there are any requests for new packages to be added to this comparison, please add them to the https://github.com/updatecompany/chip-package-comparison/issues[issues] page and we'll add them as soon as we can.

Or, if you're good with https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape], https://updatecompany.io/[get in touch with us] and we can walk you through how to import PDF, add a 0.25mm solid black border, and export the exact datasheet page to SVG.

## PDIP-14 (Plastic Dual Inline Package, 14 pins)

This package is pretty easy. It's your standard, old-school 74xx chip size. http://www.microchip.com/[Microchip] uses this package for a number of their 8-bit microcontrollers.

It looks like this. No one messes with this package.

It is through-hole, so you can throw it onto a breadboard or copper-clad perfboard without any trouble.

## SOIC-20 (Small Outline Integrated Circuit, 20 pins)

This package is used by Microchip and https://www.nxp.com/[NXP] for some of their low-complexity microcontrollers. It's also referred to as SO-20.

### Package

Microchip's package looks like this:

NXP's package looks like this, and they call it https://www.nxp.com/packages/SOT163-1[SOT163-1]:

## TSSOP-16 / TSSOP- 20 (0.65mm pin pitch, Thin-Shrink Small Outline Package)

This package is used by many companies, such as https://www.infineon.com/[Infineon], Microchip, NXP, https://www.renesas.com/[Renesas], http://www.st.com[ST], and http://www.ti.com/[TI].

If you are lucky, the footprints use the same body width for the 16-pin, and 20-pin versions.

### Package

NXP's package looks like this, and they call it https://www.nxp.com/packages/SOT360-1[SOT360-1]:
