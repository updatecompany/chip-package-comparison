# Chip Package Comparison

A comparison of chip packages and SMD land patterns from major manufacturers (NXP, STM, etc.)

Every manufacturer has a slightly different interpretation of chip packages, even if they call them by the same JEDEC name.

This page gathers up the diagrams and package names used by each company and compares them by looking at specific excerpts from chip datasheets.

## PDIP-14 (Plastic Dual Inline Package, 14 pins)

This one is pretty easy. It's your standard, old-school 74xx chip size. http://www.microchip.com/[Microchip] uses this package for a number of their 8-bit microcontrollers.

It looks like this. No one messes with this package.
