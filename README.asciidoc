# Chip Package Comparison

A comparison of chip packages and SMD land patterns from major manufacturers (NXP, STM, etc.)

Every manufacturer has a slightly different interpretation of chip packages, even if they call them by the same JEDEC, IEC, or shorthand name.

This page gathers up the diagrams and package names used by each company and compares them by looking at specific excerpts from chip datasheets.

Within a single company, we would expect that a package type has the same dimensions wherever they use it in their product lines.

Be careful, though. Always doublecheck the footprint for your specific chips, these guys don't make it easy! Between different companies, the chip sizes will very likely differ.

If there are any requests for new packages to be added to this comparison, please add them to the https://github.com/updatecompany/chip-package-comparison/issues[issues] page and we'll add them as soon as we can.

Or, if you're good with https://inkscape.org/[Inkscape], https://updatecompany.io/[get in touch with us] and we can walk you through how to import PDF, add a 0.25mm solid black border, and export the exact datasheet page to SVG.

## PDIP-14 (Plastic Dual Inline Package, 14 pins)

This package is pretty easy. It's your standard, old-school 74xx chip size. http://www.microchip.com/[Microchip] uses this package for a number of their 8-bit microcontrollers.

It looks like this. No one messes with this package.

It is through-hole, so you can throw it onto a breadboard or copper-clad perfboard without any trouble.

## SOIC-20 (Small Outline Integrated Circuit, 20 pins)

This package is used by Microchip and https://www.nxp.com/[NXP] for some of their low-complexity microcontrollers. It's also referred to as SO-20.

### Package

Microchip's package looks like this:

NXP's package looks like this, and they call it https://www.nxp.com/packages/SOT163-1[SOT163-1]:

### Solder Land Pattern

## TSSOP-20 (0.65mm pin pitch, Thin-Shrink Small Outline Package)

This package is used by many companies, such as https://www.infineon.com/[Infineon], Microchip, NXP, https://www.renesas.com/[Renesas], http://www.st.com[ST], and http://www.ti.com/[TI].

If you are lucky, the footprints use the same body width (usually ~4.4mm) for the 14-pin, 16-pin, and 20-pin versions.

It seems that most companies have settled on a 4.4mm x 6.5mm package with 0.65mm pin pitch. This is a very good thing.

#### Renesas

Renesas uses a standard pin pitch of (0.5mm) and size (10 x 10mm), though they fall into the "LFQFP" family of packages. It's a slight naming difference, but mechanically comparable.

#### Silicon Labs

Silicon Labs uses a standard pin pitch (0.5mm) and size (10 x 10mm), their chips are designated as TQFP.

## HVQFN-32: Same Name, Different Size

There will be plenty of situations where the same package name will be used by two vendors, but the physical dimensions will not match. For instance, NXP and Renesas both have packages they refer to as HVQFN-32.

Taking a closer look at the mechanical drawings, it becomes immediately clear that the chips are different sizes.

### NXP (aka https://www.nxp.com/packages/SOT865-3[SOT-865-3])

The NXP HVQFN-32 package is 7x7mm, with a pin pitch of 0.65mm.

image::32-hvqfn-nxp-package.svg[title="NXP HVQFN-32 package"]

### Renesas

The Renesas HVQFN-32 package is 5x5mm, with a pin pitch of 0.5mm.
